## Role Permissions

The bot uses a role-based permission system with the following function categories:

- `evidence_management` - For evidence-related commands
- `notification_management` - For notification-related commands

## Database Structure

The bot uses SQLite to store all data. The database includes tables for:

- Cases
- Evidence
- Judges
- Categories
- Role permissions
- Notifications

## HTML Exports

The bot can generate HTML exports of cases that include:

- Case information (title, description, status, etc.)
- All evidence submitted for the case
- All messages in the case channel with user avatars and role colors
- Messages are grouped by user and displayed in a format similar to Discord

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Errors**: Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions in your Discord server
- **Database Errors**: Check that the SQLite database file exists and is not corrupted
- **Command Not Working**: Verify that the user has the appropriate role permission for the command
